## Breaking Down the C++ Code

### Line 1: `#include <iostream>`
* **Purpose:** This line tells the compiler to include the `iostream` header file in your program.
* **Explanation:** Header files contain pre-written code for common tasks. `iostream` is a standard header file that provides input and output functionalities, such as printing to the console.

### Line 2: `int main()`
* **Purpose:** This line defines the `main` function, which is the entry point of every C++ program.
* **Explanation:**
    * `int`: Specifies that the function returns an integer value.
    * `main`: The name of the function, which is a special keyword in C++.
    * `()`: Empty parentheses indicate that the function doesn't take any arguments.

### Line 3: `std::cout << "Hello World !!" << std::endl;`
* **Purpose:** This line prints the message "Hello World !!" to the console.
* **Explanation:**
    * `std::cout`: This is an object representing the standard output stream (usually the console).
    * `<<`: The insertion operator, used to send data to the output stream.
    * `"Hello World !!"`: The string you want to print.
    * `std::endl`: This manipulator inserts a newline character and flushes the output buffer, moving the cursor to the next line.

### Line 4: `return 0;`
* **Purpose:** This line indicates that the `main` function has finished executing successfully.
* **Explanation:**
    * `return`: The `return` keyword is used to exit a function.
    * `0`: The value returned to the operating system, indicating successful program termination.

**In summary:**

The code you provided is a basic C++ program that prints the message "Hello World !!" to the console. It demonstrates the use of the `iostream` header, the `main` function, and basic output operations using `cout`.
