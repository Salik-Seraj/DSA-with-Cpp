The ternary operator in C++ (and many other programming languages) is a shorthand way to write simple `if-else` statements. It’s also known as the conditional operator.

### Format:
```cpp
condition ? expression1 : expression2;
```

### Explanation:
- `condition`: This is the expression that is evaluated. If it is true, then `expression1` is executed; if it is false, then `expression2` is executed.
- `expression1`: This is the value or expression that is returned if the condition is true.
- `expression2`: This is the value or expression that is returned if the condition is false.

### Example:
Here’s a simple example in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int a = 10, b = 20;

    // Using the ternary operator to find the maximum
    int max = (a > b) ? a : b;

    cout << "The maximum value is " << max << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

### Output:
```
The maximum value is 20
```

### How It Works:
- In the example above, the condition `(a > b)` is checked.
- If `a` is greater than `b`, the value of `a` is assigned to `max`.
- If `a` is not greater than `b`, the value of `b` is assigned to `max`.
  
The ternary operator is a compact and concise way to perform conditional assignments.
